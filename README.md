# Project Name
> I built this API + front end to satisfy the "Budgeting Project" for my "Back-End Engineer Career Path" program on Code Academy. The project consists of an API and a simple front end that allows a user to plan and monitor their personal budget using the [envelope](https://www.thebalance.com/what-is-envelope-budgeting-1293682) method.

## General Information
The purpose of this project was to demonstrate competancy in the following areas by building both an API and front end:
- Ability to write HTTP endpoints using express.js. 
- Ability to use express middleware. 
- Ability to build a dynamic front end using HTML and a linked Javacript file. 
- Ability to link the front end to the backend using asynchronous promises (async/await + fetch). 


## Technologies Used
- Express.js - version 4.17.1


## Features
List the ready features here:
- The simple front end (built with HTML and Javascript) allows the user to view currently created envelopes, add new envelopes, delete individual envelopes, and update individual envelopes. 
- Back end server with endpoints for GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE HTTP requests (either from front-end or services like Postman).

## Setup
Start by downloading the repository to your local computer and navigating to the root directory. The server can then be initialized using the `node app.js` command in your terminal. The front end can be started by copying and pasting the filepath for the index.html file into your web browser of choice. The server is hosted at **http://localhost:3000/**, although the port can be changed by editing the `port` variable in the `//Initialize Express` section of the app.js file. The app comes with three pre-made envelopes in the `//Test Envelopes` section of the app.js file. These can be changed by either editing the app.js file directly, through a service like Postman, or through the front end. 


## Project Status
Project is: _complete_


## Room for Improvement
Room for improvement:
- A prettier front end (add some CSS).
- Better client side and server side form validation.
- Some test cases.
